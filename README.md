MultiCodex is a [pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) extension that manages multiple ChatGPT Codex accounts and rotates between them automatically when you hit quota limits.

You add your Codex accounts once. After that, MultiCodex transparently picks the best available account for every request. When one account runs dry mid-session, it switches to another and retries — no manual intervention needed.

## Getting started

Install from npm:

```bash
pi install npm:@victor-software-house/pi-multicodex
```

Restart pi. That is all you need — MultiCodex takes over the normal `openai-codex` provider path and auto-imports any Codex auth you have already set up in pi.

To manage your accounts inside a session, type `/multicodex`.

## How it works

When you start a session, MultiCodex:

1. Imports your existing pi Codex auth automatically (if present).
2. Merges duplicate imported credentials into the managed pool so one account does not consume multiple rotation slots.
3. Checks usage data across all managed accounts.
4. Picks the best available account — untouched accounts first in the default mode, then the configured rotation strategy (default `lowest-usage`; optional `stable-weekly` smooths weekly burn; opt-in `capacity-first` uses a 5% guard band per window to preserve future headroom), then a random available account as fallback.

If you pin a specific account from `/multicodex accounts` or `/multicodex use`, that account is used until it hits quota, fails auth validation, or you clear the override.

When a request hits a quota or rate limit **before** any output is streamed, MultiCodex marks that account exhausted, picks the next available one, and retries. This happens up to 5 times transparently. If token validation or token refresh fails before the request starts, MultiCodex skips that account and retries another healthy one. If the manual override account fails, the override is cleared and rotation continues with the remaining accounts. Once output has started streaming, the error is surfaced as-is — no mid-stream account switching.

## Commands

Everything lives under one command: `/multicodex`.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/multicodex` | Open the main interactive menu |
| `/multicodex accounts [identifier]` | Inspect account health, select an account, add one, or directly activate/login by identifier |
| `/multicodex use [identifier]` | Alias for `/multicodex accounts [identifier]` |
| `/multicodex show` | Alias for the account-management view; in non-interactive mode it prints per-account health lines |
| `/multicodex refresh [identifier\|all]` | Refresh token validity and usage data for one account or all accounts |
| `/multicodex reauth [identifier]` | Re-authenticate one account explicitly |
| `/multicodex footer` | Configure the usage footer display |
| `/multicodex rotation` | Inspect and edit rotation settings |
| `/multicodex report` | Show active account, why it was chosen, quota totals, and per-account status |
| `/multicodex verify` | Check storage, settings, rotation, auth import, and reauth health |
| `/multicodex path` | Print storage and settings file locations |
| `/multicodex reset [manual\|quota\|all]` | Clear manual override, quota cooldowns, or both |
| `/multicodex help` | Print a compact usage line |

All subcommands support dynamic autocomplete. Account-focused subcommands autocomplete from the managed account list.

Commands that do not need a UI panel (`show`, `refresh`, `report`, `verify`, `path`, `reset`, `help`) work in non-interactive mode too.

## Account manager

The `/multicodex accounts` panel merges the old `show` and `use` flows into one place.

![MultiCodex use picker](./assets/multicodex-use-picker.png)

- **enter** activates the highlighted account.
- **u** refreshes token and usage health for the selected account.
- **r** re-authenticates the selected account.
- **d** toggles the selected account's manual disable flag.
- **n** starts login for a new managed account.
- **backspace** removes the selected account after confirmation.

Each row shows the account identifier, active/manual state, reauth state, `manuallyDisabled` state, quota state, linked imported auth state, and cached 5-hour and weekly usage windows.

When you remove an active account, MultiCodex switches to the next available one automatically.

## Usage footer

MultiCodex adds a live footer to your session showing the active account and 5-hour / 7-day usage windows with compact reset countdowns. The footer keeps `left` implicit, adds `used` only in used mode, and uses the configured separator between chunks.

You can customize the separator, account-label width, which fields appear, and their ordering with `/multicodex footer`. Changes save immediately as you edit.

## What it does under the hood

- **Provider override.** MultiCodex registers itself as the `openai-codex` provider. You do not need to select a different provider or change your model — it works with whatever Codex model you already use.
- **Auth import.** When pi has stored Codex OAuth credentials, MultiCodex imports them automatically and merges duplicate credentials into existing managed accounts when possible. When a stable `accountId` is available, it uses that as the identity match so imported auth binds to the right managed account.
- **Login flow.** When MultiCodex needs browser approval, it opens the login page and keeps the raw URL out of notifications and logs.
- **Token refresh.** OAuth tokens are refreshed before expiry so requests do not fail due to stale credentials. You can also force a health refresh with `/multicodex refresh` or re-authenticate explicitly with `/multicodex reauth`.
- **Command routing.** `commands.ts` stays as the dispatcher and autocomplete registry, while account-flow orchestration lives in `account-flows.ts`.
- **Session restoration.** On session start, MultiCodex waits for account restoration before refreshing the footer, so stale manual pins are revalidated before the new session renders.
- **Usage tracking.** Usage data is fetched from the Codex API and cached for 5 minutes per account. The footer renders cached data immediately and refreshes in the background.
- **Rotation settings.** The rotation panel persists selection strategy (`lowest-usage`, `stable-weekly`, or `capacity-first`), the `guardRelaxation` toggle, untouched-account preference, unknown-reset fallback cooldown, and pre-stream retry count in `settings.json`. `capacity-first` keeps a 5% per-window guard band unless guard relaxation is enabled.
- **Quota cooldown.** When an account is exhausted, it stays on cooldown until its next known reset time (or 1 hour if the reset time is unknown).
- **Shared utility seams.** Provider mirroring, stream primitives, and `~/.pi/agent/*` path helpers are shared with `pi-credential-vault` through `@victor-software-house/pi-provider-utils`. MultiCodex still owns account storage, token policy, footer behavior, and command UX.

## Local development

This repo uses `mise` for tool versions and `bun` for dependency management.

```bash
mise install          # pin tool versions
bun install           # install dependencies
bun run check         # lint + typecheck + test
npm pack --dry-run    # verify package contents
```

Run the extension directly during development:

```bash
pi -e ./index.ts
```

## Data storage

MultiCodex stores all data locally under `~/.pi/agent/`:

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `codex-accounts.json` | Managed account credentials and state, including `manuallyDisabled` flags |
| `settings.json` (key `pi-multicodex`) | Footer display preferences |

No data is sent anywhere except to the Codex API endpoints for auth refresh and usage queries.

## Release process

Use conventional commits and `bun run release:dry` when you want to cut a release.

Local push protection via `lefthook` runs the same checks as local validation before every push.

## Roadmap

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for planned work including configurable rotation settings, a shared controller architecture, and immediate footer persistence.

## Prior art and how this project differs

This extension builds on ideas from two earlier pi extensions. Both deserve credit for establishing the patterns that made this project possible.

### [kim0/pi-multicodex](https://github.com/kim0/pi-multicodex)

The original MultiCodex extension by [kim0](https://github.com/kim0). It introduced the core concept: manage multiple Codex OAuth accounts and rotate between them on quota failures. The original shipped as a single `index.ts` file (~990 lines) with three top-level commands (`/multicodex-login`, `/multicodex-use`, `/multicodex-status`), a stream wrapper for transparent retries, and account selection logic that prefers untouched accounts and earliest weekly resets.

This fork diverged significantly:

- **Modular architecture.** Split into 17 focused modules (~2,400 lines of runtime code, ~1,200 lines of tests) instead of one monolithic file.
- **Command family.** One `/multicodex` command with subcommands and dynamic autocomplete, replacing three separate top-level commands.
- **Account removal.** In-session account deletion from the picker via `Backspace` with confirmation — the original had no way to remove accounts without editing the JSON file.
- **Non-interactive mode.** All inspection and recovery subcommands (`show`, `verify`, `path`, `reset`, `help`) work without a UI panel.
- **Auth import.** Automatically imports pi's stored `openai-codex` credentials when they change, so existing pi logins work without re-entering them.
- **Token refresh.** Proactively refreshes OAuth tokens before expiry instead of failing on stale credentials.
- **Local releases.** semantic-release with bun-based checks, commitlint, and lefthook pre-push validation.

### [calesennett/pi-codex-usage](https://github.com/calesennett/pi-codex-usage)

A footer-only extension by [calesennett](https://github.com/calesennett) that shows Codex usage windows in the pi status bar. It introduced the idea of a live footer displaying 5-hour and 7-day usage percentages with reset countdowns, and offered two commands to toggle display mode and reset window.

This project incorporated and extended that footer concept:

- **Integrated footer.** The usage footer is part of the rotation extension rather than a separate install, so it always reflects the active rotated account.
- **More settings.** Five configurable fields (usage mode, reset window, show account, show reset countdown, footer order) compared to two toggles.
- **Settings panel.** Interactive `SettingsList` modal with live preview instead of separate toggle commands.
- **Colored segments.** Footer renders usage percentages, separators, and account labels in distinct colors matched to the terminal theme.
- **Severity-based colors.** Usage percentages shift through four color tiers (green, amber, warning, error) as quota depletes — green above 50% remaining, amber at 50%, warning at 25%, red at 10% or below. The thresholds flip automatically when the display mode is set to "used" instead of "left."
- **Model-aware display.** Footer clears when switching to non-Codex models and debounces rapid model changes.
